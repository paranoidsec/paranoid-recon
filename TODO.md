# TODO / Short-term Roadmap (Paranoid-Recon)

> Actionable tasks and priorities â€” updated continuously.

## Priority: High

- [ ] Finalize sanitized demo GIF/screenshot for README and release notes. (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)
- [ ] Create `INSTALL.md` with exact install commands for required tools (subfinder, nmap). (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow that runs the monitor in artifact-only mode (no commits). (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)
- [ ] Prepare marketing assets: 1-page PDF "ParanoidS3c Toolkit" & printable business card QR linking to GitHub. (Owner: @BashBunny)

## Priority: Medium

- [ ] Implement `--bruteforce` option (careful: warn about noise and scope). (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)
- [ ] Add JSON/CSV output mode for `recon.sh` (for easier automation). (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)
- [ ] Add small unit/integration test run (example against example.com). (Owner: @ParanoidS3c)

## Priority: Low / Later

- [ ] Split monitor into `paranoid-monitor` repo (if productized). (Owner: TBD)
- [ ] Add more data sources integrations. (Owner: TBD)

## Notes

- Keep all demo outputs sanitized (no PII or private targets).
- Use Issues to track multi-step work and to link PRs to specific tasks.
